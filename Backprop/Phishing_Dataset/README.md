# Phishing Website Predictions 

A model for predicting if a website is a phishing site and the data used are within this folder. A big issue faced with this dataset was the runtime. With just 2 hidden neuron layers with only 1 neuron each the runtime of training the network (with high error in the beginning) was -
```python
CPU times: user 38.5 s, sys: 85.4 ms, total: 38.5 s
Wall time: 38.6 s
```
The process of improving the time was a mix of changing out for loops
