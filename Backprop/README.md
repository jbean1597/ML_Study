# Backpropogation

Building off of what was covered in the perceptron module, backpropogation introduces the final piece to the neural network basics. A multilayer perceptron network is created and then tested with multiple datasets. This network is built within a python class to familiarize myself better with classes and also to make the hyperparameters and activation functions easily changeable.
